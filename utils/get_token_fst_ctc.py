By default there is an optional silence phone in between words.
To model this word-level silence, we need the special silence token(s).
Here are two possible methods to deal with the word-level silence:
    1. Do not introduce silence tokens at all. In CTC, the blank label can be applied to deal with the silence, and in other topos, we may introduce a <blk>-<eps> self-loop at the start state.
    2. Introduce the silence token(s). This results in an extra token <SIL> in CTC and potentially multiple tokens in other topos. However, in CTC, <SIL> and <blk> may have some function overlap.
        In other topos, multiple silence tokens may be needed to deal with the silence.
After all, I think the first option is better as it is closer to most readily available implementation, where there is no special treatment for silence except the blank label.
For this reason, I set ignore_silence_between_words = True by default.
